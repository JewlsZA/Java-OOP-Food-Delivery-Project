## My Java OOP Food Delivery Project
In this project I explore my new skills with Object Orientated Programming in Java. 
# What does this program do ?
This program requests the user to input details of a customer and restaurant object.
The user can then select a customer and restaurant to create a food order.
The user is prompt to add food items and quantity to their order.
An driver is selected from a text data set of drivers depending on his location and current deliveries.
If a driver is found, a Order is created and printed to a text file.
Two more informational text files are also generated.
# Where to start ?
Start by opening the project in a java compatable IDE.
Run the main class quickfood.java.
Follow the menu selections.
